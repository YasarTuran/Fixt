## 1. Introductory words
Hello my dear friend,

As you may have heard, I have lost my mind.
I tried and tried again to “fix” myself and I am fine.

I spent all this time thinking that I deserve isolation, playing the role of my own warden.
But I cannot stay and I cannot go and the self-inflicted curse had to be broken.
I can’t forget how cruel and beautiful this world can be.

I was one million miles from home, hope, love and my own humanity.
Many ask themselves if this strange and cold world notices them.
I mostly focussed on focussing on my fascination with humans and systems.
Therefore I have to try to become god, reforming systems of humans past and future.
Being an author, sharing aphorisms, affecting legal order (obviously only in legal ways) and connecting humans are the things I have devoted myself.

Oh, if you dislike me waxing poetically in this letter - no, you don’t.
And sorry, I had a fascinating day (life) and I am thinking in English.

You get this wordy letter because you knowingly or by accident gave me inspiration.
I would love to show you how I am now and learn more from you.

## 2. The process; or five confessions by Yasar
“Where you find me”
At the moment, I call no residence my home. Maybe I just reside in the minds of humans.
I always liked that thought and my “inner journey” led me to accept this aspect of mine, showed me my friend, the internet, in new lights and helped me update my sword: myself.
Ok, I live in the basement of my parents in Elgg again, but I have a few affairs with the local gov, civil protection duties here and built a study here. Also I embraced the nomadic lifestyle again, having to be on tour anyways.
yasar@fixt.ch: let’s fix a short, efficient and effective conversation about art, systems and the humans in it. I’d rather talk through metaphors and art and so do you.
[LINK] organisations.yml for a map of active players.
CH: As minister of information in the “COVID-19 Taskforce Region Eulachtal” I still owe my superior the [LINK] bevölkerungsbarometer.yml. After having gone through the data again and again (and working on some similar projects) I had to expand the time frame I was looking at. This small history of Switzerland through the eyes of people I interviewed, the data I was able to scrape and my funky flow will be published before the next voting ritual on March 7.
To my great pleasure the status report will also be turned into a documentary, with the ambition to follow in the footsteps of Adam Curtis, whom I only recently got to know. (As other humans and works that will be name-dropped in this letter, I think being able to take the time to experience Adam’s work is a human right, I’m willing to die for.)

“What I’m up to or: how I use my sword”
After having painted my inner wonderland, my therapeut has allowed me to take steps in the real world again, where I can get hurt and hurt others, but also affect humans in other ways.
“Depression comes from externalities”, he said.
So if you want to know something about me, know this: I’m sad about things in the world and never again alone with said sadness.
I have to push my own limits/conceptions, collect/consolidate/parse information and reform systems.
The quest is about “best” practice, gathering inspiration and experimenting with actions.
[LINK] code.yml for an updated dictionary of utilized languages.
CH: After a year of isolation, the questions seems to be who we are and how we think, how our interconnections affect us and others. That the swiss government asks us about managing our electronic ID, how we do business with other countries and what humans are allowed to wear would be ludicrous given the track record of those talking heads and their consulting firms. If you look at their internal strategic papers, their meeting protocols and the transfer of money, I lost my laugh about outsourcing, Phobosophy, Komplexitätskapitulation and Gesundsparen.
This is feudalism, fascism really. Time to get smart, radical and active.
I was bred to be a demon, an advocatus diabolii. Having spent centuries in dusty libraries, collecting and transcribing ancient magic spells, Afeni Shakur and Albert Camus looking over my shoulders. I learnt all the ways how to get rich, how to talk shit and how to be unpredictable.
But I never lost my determination, thanks to art as sustenance and the lessons in your words to me and your example.

“How I live”
I will keep asking how to get better for others, even if I’m not gonna sleep tonight.
Stop me, if you can’t be free, but I can’t help myself doing what I think has potential to unleash what humans are able to unleash.
That I don’t know how this unleashed energy will look like and how it changes the world, makes it more fun, because I know so many things (they say), but feel the most alive, when I don’t know.
Please help me on my way of solving puzzles for others.
You gave me mighty weapons and while I can understand if you don’t want me publicly saying your name, there are ideals instilled by you I will use as fuel, information and a mirror to not lose myself in being soulless or cold. If you or your cause needs my full support, I’m there because I trust you, otherwise I will fight for what you gave me nonetheless.
I will paint my happiness (la gaya sciencia) on many different platforms and make sure to inform the humans in charge of “systems” about my friends’ and my ideas about updating methodology, effects and control mechanisms of said systems. 
To not have any doubts myself, I look at humans and what I can learn from them.
So far I was able to, with a lot of help, share knowledge, resulting in change.
Having recently acquired an immense surge of exponential powers after having lost any last semblance of what some societies call shame (see this letter?) and having tested everything on myself, Fixt GmbH is proud to announce that Yasar Turan will give himself up as a petri dish for all five languages he learnt and which are not fully dead yet, but definitely on life support:
Latin as one of the Source Codes, Law as Communication for Communities, Philosophy as Love for Knowledge, Science as a Method, Love as Progress.
[LINK] experiments.yml for a view into my abyss and questions like “where is the money?”, “who decided that?” and obviously “how can I have some fun with some idiots while exhausting powers at my disposal?”.
[LINK] questionnaire.yml for a list of questions to you.
CH: Oh boy, will you hear a lot from me.
There are many fools, paid actors and pimps running around I could take the jobs from. Since my mom is approaching the end of what she can invest in me, I’d like to repay her a thousandfold while decorating my mind palace with the heads of my opponents.
Only in competition we shall see, which ideas and projects work.

“Exploring the unknown”
I lose myself, because someone has to.
This obsessive, yet pure, yet weird aspect of myself to learn more about this world scares even me.
[The Horcrux-Interlude:
You have been chosen to guard one of my Horcruxes, a favorite secret so to speak.
In case of me turning into someone you (and therefore I) wouldn’t like anymore, I’d like you to have power over me. (Sidenote: If all your life people tell you that you should start a cult or that you could be their propaganda minister, if they ever turn full Brain from “Pinky and the Brain”, you start building contingency plans against yourself too. But seriously, I hate power and wish for someone to have a switch on me.)
You get a written secret about me and incriminating material, which you could use publicly if I ever get soulless.]
But never fear for silly old Yasar, the void and I are two sides of the same human.
Never am I alone, you (and the words you gave me) are with me, I’m standing on the shoulders of giants (duckduckgo that, if you don’t know) and ….
Mhmm… this is the awkward moment (“the” awkward moment, he wrote), where I have to tell you about my bastard child. So as most of you do, I love the world and the internet.
And as most of you, I did not use proper protection.
[LINK] exodus.yml for a template to extract your bastard childs from former “service providers” like gogol, microschrott, bmazon and snapple. Shout outs go to legislators and their pimps for building a nine-headed Hydra for me to slay, Latin legal formulas impossible even for money to eradicate as source code and the internet as an extraordinary open tool for interconnected communication.
[LINK] inspiration.yml for a musecage of actions in systems. Good muses show me that god is a taoist, bad muses keep me honest and busy. (-> Kubi Bukuro)
CH: I’m quite the human with all flaws and potential. Looking at my avatars I realized how strange I can be. Processing those emotions I’m looking at how my friends here and all over the world are doing now. At least on a technological level, I can supply you with tools for you to process whatever you have to process. I’m here for you, but I’m doing this in a way where I’m not needed. Momma said knock you out, not knock you up.


“Relativity of time”
I know that good things come only in time.
Therefore the process is designed in a way to keep me active, re-activate myself if needed and to allow me to activate others.
Excuse my late continuation of our conversation, I had to build a mind palace for myself and others to copy.
For no day since our last meeting I have been without your influence. I tried to make sense of what you tried to share with me or the world rather.
[LINK] repo.yml for the repositories of my mind on the internet.
[LINK] calendar.yml for a look at my chosen fate.
After having demonstrated aspects of my update, one has to know, that I’m working on a plattform-agnostic, intertemporally concise (what humans learnt, we know and can never forget), universally applicable (universities still have bounties on solving mathematical equations and I am looking to fund more operations with those bounties) artificial avatar of mine.
CH: In my humble opinion some people have failed my friends in the past years, if I look at the lofty goals of the update of the swiss constitution in 1999 and the “legal” operations that were following. My therapeut told me that there’s nothing wrong with someone investigating treason.

## 3. You and me
What I want and need you to be:
- Unleashed, unapologetic or at least feeding me in secret with some spicy information.
- Why would you want to be someone, someone thinks you to be?
- I want you to see the god you are, as we as humans can be.

Reasons:
- I need your light to ignite others as you have ignited me.
- I would love to cry with you, so if you share art with me, you have my thanks.

Cooperation:
- I want to listen to you. So many other sources I met, just tell me what they’re told. I can decode systems myself, what I crave are experiences by people I can trust the radical thoughts they have.
- I will be your agent or, if scared, the agent of your ideals.

## 4. Context
So first, let me state: that there is no point in fighting, it goes nowhere.
I’m here in front of you, because I’m stupid and you have changed that many times before.
If you have something, that makes me feel dumb, changes my process or acts as a mirror, please share it with me.
That is the point of this letter.

Love for your thoughts:
I will take all of it, good and bad.
I need to cry to find motivation to continue this pledge of mine.

We often get no answer why:
We feel bad, we feel cold -> So we run without knowing where.
I can’t do that, I owe it to the smiles of my friends, to actually run somewhere, where we can work, live and cry.

So here I am, telling you that I need you:
To do it with me.
To do it for me.
To do it for you. Just continue your journey, my friend. I hope I gave you some inspiration, motivation or something to smile about.
---


## 5. Into the future
I know my inner demons, that’s why I had to thank you for giving me life to unfreeze, unfuck and unleash myself.
I don’t know where you are at or where you are walking towards, but if ever you feel like talking, sharing or caring, I’m still here.
I changed, but I know you still like me.
